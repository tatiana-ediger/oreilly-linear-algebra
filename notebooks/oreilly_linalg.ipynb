However, for some square matrices $A$, it may still be the case that $A^{-1}$ may not exist. The quick way to check for invertibility is to find the determinant [1] of a matrix.

    "<b><u>Principle Component Analysis</u></b> In machine learning when trying to train a model from a given dataset, you'll often find yourself having really high-dimensional data (i.e., a really large value of d). This is often hard to deal with, and if you can break it into a smaller set of \"summary indices\", then it is easier to analyze and visualize your data. One way to deal with this is by using <b>Principal Component Analysis</b> (PCA), where you calculate a projection of the original data into the same number of or fewer dimensions. In order to do PCA, you need to understand eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",

    "<b><u>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</u></b> Eigen in German means characteristic, so *eigenvector* means characteristic vector. In order to get a better understanding of what this means, it's useful to return back to our geometric interpretation of linear algebra. Just as we could think of vectors as location and direction, we can think of matrices as linear transformations, where matrix-vector multiplication transforrms a vector. With this idea in mind, we can define $\\lambda$ as the <b>eigenvalue</b> for a matrix $A$ for corresponding non-zero <b>eigenvector</b> $\\vec{x}$ such that $A\\vec{x} = \\lambda\\vec{x}$. Intuitively, this definition means that multiplying $A$ by the vector $\\vec{x}$ results in a new vector that points in the same direction as $\\vec{x}$, but scaled by a factor $\\lambda$. You can only find eigenvalues and eigenvectors for square matrices, and there can only be (at most) as many eigenvectors as the dimension of the matrix. "
